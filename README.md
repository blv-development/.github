# hi!

We are Blind/Low-Vision developers (BLV Devs), a diverse group of passionate people enthusiastic about tech and committed to making this field accessible to more and more people with limited to no vision.

In this organization, youâ€™ll find all the work weâ€™ve put out for the public â€” and you can even contribute if you like! ðŸš€

If youâ€™re serious about calling development, or other fields of tech such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, your career, join us. The community is growing day by day, and we would love to have you as one of its members. We come from all corners, with a diverse set of histories and skillsets, so weâ€™re sure youâ€™ll find someone you can relate to and seek guidance from.

You can learn more about us and what we stand for on our [website](https://blvdevelopers.org).

Thanks for visiting! ðŸ”¥
